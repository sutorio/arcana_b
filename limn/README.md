## Overview

TODO: (it's for development of WGSL shaders)

## External Tools

### [WGShaderToy](https://github.com/fralonra/wgshadertoy)

A WGSL playground, inspired by Shadertoy.

### [Shadershop](https://github.com/cdglabs/Shadershop). 

> Shadershop is an interface for programming GPU shaders in the mode of a direct manipulation image editor like Photoshop. 
> It is an experiment in leveraging the programmer’s spatial reasoning the way that coding today leverages the programmer’s symbolic reasoning.

Browser-based tool. UI is built around manipulation of graphs.

### [glsl2wgsl](https://github.com/eliotbo/glsl2wgsl)

Rust CLI tool to convert GLSL shaders to WGSL. The online version (probably most useful) is [here](https://eliotbo.github.io/glsl2wgsl/)

### [Shaderfrog online GLSL editor](https://shaderfrog.com/app/editor)

Node-based tool for building shaders.

### [Noise and Texture](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1138854718618193875/Noise-%26-Texture)

Figma plugin for creating procedural textures. Included here as those textures are shaders, and the tool exposes a shader editor interface.

### [Online WGSL editor](https://github.com/takahirox/online-wgsl-editor)

Tiny JS-based shader editor.
NOTE: must be used in Chrome (or flags on FF need to be set to allow for the features required).

### [Nanovis shader editor](https://shadereditor.kaust.edu.sa/new)

Online WGSL shader editor (research project).
NOTE: must be used in Chrome (or flags on FF need to be set to allow for the features required).
NOTE: forked [here](https://github.com/DanCouper/Shader-Editor), should I wish to port and improve it.
